# OCR
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process of extracting and interpreting text from images or scanned documents. It allows computers to "read" text from sources like photos of printed or handwritten text, PDFs, and images of documents. In Python, OCR is commonly implemented using libraries like Tesseract and EasyOCR, among others.
